# ObjectS
Java toString into JS toString

## The goal : Java x JS
The objective of this little project is to let JS developpers who are brand new to java keep their former way to show their object. And as Java Classes are really close to JS Objects with their structure, i've decided to write a class that **DOES NOTHING** but create a clean and confy way to display Java Instances.

## Display

The objects are displayed like that : 

```json
{
  attributeName(type) : value
  attributeNameArray(arrayType) : [
    attribute,
    attribute,
  objectAttributeName(ObjectType) : {
    attributeName(type) : value
    attributeName(type) : value
  }
}
```
